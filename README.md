This script will parse WhatsApp chat exports and provide monthly stats by user for the following:

2. Messages per user per hour of the day
3. Messages per user for a specified search term

To get the export file from WhatsApp may differ based on the version.  At the time of this writing on an Android device, tap the 3 dots in the top right, choose More from the menu, then Export Chat.

Save the file locally and run this script against it.
Usage instructions can be found by running the script.
